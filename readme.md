## Non-Profit Restuarants in the United States 

#### One World Everybody Eats 

This map represents 14 member cafes of the non-profit restaurant organization One World Everybody Eats, as well as the corresponding state poverty percentages. This map aims to tell the story of intersectionality between the number of people in poverty and those who are food insecure.

Food insecurity affects 17 million households in every county in America. The correlation between poverty and higher rates of food insecurity calls for a unique approach to fighting hunger. One World Everybody Eats is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt, non-profit organization dedicated to increasing food security and building community through its pay-what-you-can nonprofit restaurant model. The organization provides a unique local solution to the global issue of hunger.

Today, the organization supports nearly 50 independent cafes and start-up cafes in its network with education, collaboration, best practice sharing, and networking opportunities. 

#### Poverty Percent Explanation

A poverty rate above 20 percent is generally considered high. Based on this threshold, I have set the maximum variable for my data range at 20 percent. Among the ten states included in the data, four states fall within the 11-15 percent poverty range, with one state having the highest rate at 16 percent. These elevated poverty levels emphasize the urgent need for more accessible, affordable, and localized food systems that can better serve food-insecure populations in these regions.
